Before we begin, I will say that I'm not responsible for what you do with this, this tool is a grey area. Also, credit to aep since he helped me with this

This tool is intended to provide a way to download games from the Wii Shop directly onto your Wii, even after shutdown.

After the disaster that was Rii Shop where I was hit with a accusation that I used it to dox people, which was false (and I got harassment and some scary stuff happened as a result and it devastated me how the community reacted), people have tried making a Wii Shop revival themselves, however I found that all of them have failed to make a working shop revival. None of them worked...until now.

How does this work? You install a patched IOS56 for the Wii Shop Channel, install a ton of tickets, and then use this homebrew app to select what game you want from the Wii Shop Channel, and it launches the shop then navigates to the download page in the Wii Shop Channel.

Here are the instructions to set this up.

1. Download the zip and extract it to your SD. This will take a little bit, because thousands of WAD files containing tickets are in the zip.
2. Launch Wii Mod Lite. (Yet Another WAD Manager ModMii and Some YAWMM Mod will not work because they don't let you install a whole folder of WADs.)
3. Go into WAD Manager and install the corresponding IOS56 for your system in the ios folder, Wii or Wii U. Make sure you select the right one.
4. Open the ticket folder. Your Wii will freeze. Come back in 15-25 minutes, as it will take a while to load every ticket.
5. Press 1 to install all the WADs. These contain the tickets necessary for downloading on the Wii Shop Channel. It will take a while. You will see a error on every WAD installation. This is normal.
6. Open Wii Shoplifting Channel and select the game you want to download. The Wii Shop Channel will download the game and it will appear on your Wii Menu
